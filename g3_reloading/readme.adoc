Purpose:

* Grails 3 Application/Plugin combination demonstrating that changes in controllers/views of plugin are not properly reloaded by application.

Created with:

* `grails create-plugin g3reloadingplugin`

Reproduce with:

* in folder _g3reloadingapp_ invoke `../gradlew bootRun'
* point your browser to http://localhost:8080/plug/index which should show: `Plugin page 3`
* in _PlugController.groovy_ change _3_ to _4_ in the model
* the console reports: File _...g3reloadingplugin/PlugController.groovy changed, recompiling..._ but when your reload the page in the browser there is no change visible.
